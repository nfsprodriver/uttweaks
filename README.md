This is a repo where some edited system files from Ubuntu Touch will be uploaded.

Everything you use from here is on your own risk! Generally you should have a writable filesystem and restart your phone to make the changes working. The scripts are concipated for armhf devices and should be run as root. If you have a different architecture, make the commands fit to your system. If a scripts isn't executable, run "sudo chmod +x SCRIPT" . Feel free to add your changes via pull requests :)
